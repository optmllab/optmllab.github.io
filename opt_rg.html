<h1>Optimization Reading Group</h1>

<p><b>The goal of the seminar</b> is to read papers on the selected topic, generate new ideas and solutions.</p>

<p><b>The main rule of the seminar:</b> it is forbiden to participate without reading the paper before the seminar. We introduce this rule
to focus more on the specific details and generating new ideas during the seminars. Besides this rule, we do not impose any specific
rules going beyond adequate scientific behavior.</p>
